# Life_Expectancy_Prediction Model
# INTRODUCTION:
Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the estimate of the span of a life. It is sometimes used referring to inanimate objects, i.e. a building, but is generally used to estimate the average life span of living things, more specifically human life. This average is calculated based on the year of birth, sex, and region, factoring in the causes of mortality that would most likely affect the particular population.
